# laser artisan box
 Just an artisan box designed to be completely made on a laser it is made for 3mm thick acryllic or any other 3mm thick material.

You need 4 sets of the dividers and 4 outside walls

The no tolerances version has a zero tolerance in the parts that slot into eachother. Maybe your laser burns away enough of the material to use it like that.


Note the non tolerance files may contain double lines because fusion was being fucky so your laser may go over the same spot twice.

# laser artisan box
 Just an artisan box designed to be completely made on a laser it is made for 3mm thick acryllic or any other 3mm thick material.

You need 4 sets of the dividers and 4 outside walls

The no tolerances version has a zero tolerance in the parts that slot into eachother. Maybe your laser burns away enough of the material to use it like that.
